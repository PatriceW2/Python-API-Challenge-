Observations found when analying the Weather data:

 - Cities closer to the equator (latitude of 0)  have a higher maximum temperature than cities that are farther away from the equator. This is to be expected and is not a surprise after looking at the data.
 
 - What is interesting is that the distance of the city from the equator does not have an impact as to how humid the city is.  The cities with high humidity are all over the map.
 
  - There is a positive correlation between latitide and cloudiness on both the Southern Hemisphere and the Norhern Hemisphere.
  
  - When it comes to windspeed the Northern Hemisphere seems to be on average equally windy no matter where in this part of the world you may be,  whereas in the Southern Hemisphere the closer you are located to the equator,  the less windy the location.
